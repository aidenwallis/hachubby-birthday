# HAchubby Birthday Card

A little project that makes a neat little birthday card viewer for [HAchubby's](https://twitch.tv/hachubby) birthday. The code is far from good, and is something I rushed off in a couple of hours, but works nicely.

Images are pulled from the greetingcard CDN in the same way the website does it, everything else is good ol' raw, custom CSS/JS. Uses parcel-bundler and uses github actions to automatically push this onto GitHub Pages.

That's pretty much it! Consider this project inactive, just made it as a nice way to view it.
